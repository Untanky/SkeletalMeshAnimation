Enclosed you will find all files necessary for assignment 1
of computer graphics 1 (CG 1). You will need freeglut to compile
the code and run the binary. Freeglut is available for both win32
and linux and macosx platforms, and is open source, and more modern
and actively maintained than the original (very outdated) GLUT. For windows users, freeglut is included with the skeleton code, linux users use the freeglut package coming with their distribution, and Mac OSX users will need to install XQuartz.

Also, we extensively use a very well-designed library, glm, 
which implements deprecated OpenGL functions, and uses GLSL 
(OpenGL shading language) syntax, and therefore is, as far as
I know, one-of-a-kind.

This zip archive contains the Visual Studio workspace 
and project files and also Linux and Mac makefiles. 
Simply type 'make -f Makefile.linux' in a Linux console 
to compile with g++. To compile on a Mac simple type 
'make -f Makefile.macosx' in the Terminal 

To get an idea of what a possible solution could look like, 
try the enclosed binaries in the 'win32' / 'linux' / 'macosx'
subdirectories.

For the five cg1 assignment demos there will be a windows 7 pc 
and an ubuntu pc available in my office, but it has proven to be 
more "stable" to bring own laptop computers.

I would strongly urge all participants to use C/C++ 
throughout this course. I am aware of (and use) jogl for Java, 
but the code skeletons I will provide for cg1 are all C/C++
*only*. You are allowed to use Java/jogl, but be aware that
you will need to port the skeleton code for all assignments.
Warning: the skeleton code for cg1 is usually very large.
Same applies to Haskell, Lisp, Python, etc.

Finally, any questions concering the code and/or assignment 
should be directed to
